            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>Hello for a third time! So, Bean Salad may not sound super exciting, and in some ways,
                you're absolutely correct! However, it is super delicious and easy to make. Also,
                it makes a great side for the cookout, pot-luck, or (if you add chicken like in this
                specific recipe) a quick weeknight dinner option. So, I don't know, here you go, I guess!
            </p>
            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Your 2 or 3 favorite beans! I prefer Chick peas and Black beans,
                    But really and bean will work!
